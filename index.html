The console screen is used to print stuff from js to the html page. To open it you have to right click on the page after clicking "live preview" on the code screen. Then, click console and view it all. If you want to print anything on the console you just type your code then put console.log(your variable/storage thing).

    var first_name = "Ranbir";
    console.log(first_name)
    var last_name = "Kapoor";
    console.log(last_name)

    console.log(full_name);
    var a = 10;

    var subtract = a - b ;
